# Johnson_Insect_Responses
This is a repo for data and codes for my (Chris Johnson) research on the temperature responses of hemipteran insects

Files:
* DDE population dynamics.py (Python code for modelling population dynamics using delay differential equations)
* Egwuatu_1977.csv (data file containing temperature and population densities for _Clavigralla tomentosicollis_ in Nigeria)
* ODE population dynamics.R (R code for modelling population dynamics using ordinary differential equations)
* Temperature response data.csv (data file containing model parameters)
