# Johnson_Insect_Responses
This is a repo for data and codes for my (Chris Johnson) research on the temperature responses of hemipteran insects

See "Project overview.docx" for more up-to-date information, I will update this README at a later date

Files (needs to be updated):
* DDE population dynamics.py (Python code for modeling dynamics using delay differential equations)
* Habitat temperatures.R (R code for fitting habitat temperature function)
* ODE population dynamics.R (R code for modelling population dynamics using ordinary differential equations)
* Temperature response data.csv (data file containing raw data on life history trait temperature responses)
* Temperature response parameters.csv (data file containing model parameters)
* Temperature responses.R (R code for fitting functions to temperature response data)
* Time series <species name>.csv (data file containing DDE output from DDE population dynamics.py)
* Time series models.R (R code for plotting model output with empirical time-series data)
