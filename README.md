# Insect_Responses_Climate_Change
This is a repo containing the data and scripts for the submitted manuscript "Temperature sensitivity of fitness components across life cycles drives insect responses to climate change"

[Computational pipeline](https://github.com/trenchproject/Johnson_Insect_Responses/blob/main/Computational_pipeline.png)

Folder Structure:
* Biological data (contains field census data from Benin and China and laboratory temperature response data)
* Climate data (contains "Climate station data.xlsx" and CSV files for historical and future climate data files)
* DDE population dynamics.py (Python script for modeling insect population dynamics)
* Documentation (contains ReadMe files for downloading Python and climate data as well as scripts for fitting functions to data)
* Extensions beyond manuscript (contains scripts and data for analyses beyond the scope of the manuscript)
* Model parameters (contains "Habitat temperature parameters.csv" and "Temperature response parameters.csv" for model parameters)
* Model TPC analyses(R script for analyzing fitness metrics/components directly from TPCs and from the population model for Figs. 3-4)
* Population analyses.R (R script for analyzing predicted population dynamics for Fig. 5)
* Project overview.docx (Word document containing information on the project workflow and how climate data was accessed)
* Scripts (contains scripts for downloading Python and climate data)
